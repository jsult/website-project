            <h1>I am an IT student.</h1>
            <p>And I'm passionate about my field of study. However, it was not always
               like this. When I finished school, I quite randomly chose to study international
               law and was soon disappointed with my choice. But giving up was not an option, so
               I graduated after 5 years of studying.
                <br> Since I didn't want to work as a lawer I had to start with something new and
                I chose math. Quite randomly again, but this time it was a better match.
                I thought that I finally found the right thing for me, but then I had my
                first programming lecture and understood immediately that THAT was the right thing.
                And now here I am, on the exciting journey of becomming a professional programmer.

            <p>
                There are many things that I enjoy doing. One of them is of course coding and
                solving challenging tasks, but that's not all. My second biggest passion is
                languages. My dream is to be able to speak 5 foreign languages one day.
                I like to spend time outside, walking or riding a bike and from all sports I prefer yoga.
                And chess, actually, since it's also considered to be a sport. And one thing that I probably
                like most of all is learning new things.
