        <p> This site is an example of what I was capable of learning
        and implementing within two weeks. Before this challenge I had some
        very basic knowledge of HTML that needed to be refreshed anyway and a general
        understanding what CSS does, but no practical experience with it.
        It was a lot of fun working on this project and even though this
        site is not perfect and there is still a lot to be learned, it's the
        progress that matters, isn't it?
